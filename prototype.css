/*
Write your CSS for prototype.html here!
Use the em unit and the size is handled for you based on the aspect ratio of the browser

Despite these being pixel based units, they are premultiplied against the DPI scale so
you can use them without worrying about scale at all.

Where you can't use em units, use percents.
